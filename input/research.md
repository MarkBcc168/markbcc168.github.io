    Let $n$, $s$, and $k$ be positive integers. We say that a sequence $f_1, \dots,f_s$ of nonnegative integers is <i>satisfying</i> if for any collection of $s$ families $\mathcal F_1,\dots,\mathcal F_s\subseteq [n]^k$ such that $|\mathcal F_i|=f_i$ for all $i$, there exists a rainbow matching, i.e., a list of pairwise disjoint tuples  $F_1\in\mathcal F_1$, $\dots$, $F_s\in\mathcal F_s$. We investigate the question, posed by Kupavskii  and Popova, of determining the smallest $c=c(n,s,k)$ such that the arithmetic progression  $c$, $n^{k-1}+c$, $2n^{k-1}+c$, $\dots$, $(s-1)n^{k-1}+c$ is satisfying. We prove that the sequence is satisfying for $c=\Omega_k(\max(s^2n^{k-2}, sn^{k-3/2}\sqrt{\log s}))$, improving the previous result by Kupavskii and Popova. We also study satisfying sequences for $k=2$ using the polynomial method, extending the previous result by Kupavskii and Popova  to when $n$ is not prime.

    Let $Y$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb Q$. We provide a method to systematically search for possible candidates of a prime $\ell\geq 3$ and a genus $1$ curve $X$ for which there exists a genus $3$ curve $Z$ over $\mathbb Q$ whose Jacobian is, up to quadratic twist, $(\ell, \ell, \ell)$-isogenous to the product of Jacobians of $X$ and $Y$, building on the work by Hanselman, Schiavone, and Sijsling for $\ell=2$. We find several such pairs $(X,Y)$ for prime $\ell$ up to $13$. We also improve their numerical gluing algorithm, allowing us to successfully glue genus $1$ and genus $2$ curves along their $13$-torsion.

    Given a chain of $HW$ cubes where each cube is marked "turn $90^\circ$" or "go straight", when can it fold into a $1 \times H \times W$ rectangular box? We prove several variants of this (still) open problem NP-hard:
    (1) allowing some cubes to be wildcard (can turn or go straight);
    (2) allowing a larger box with empty spaces (simplifying a proof from CCCG 2022);
    (3) growing the box (and the number of cubes) to $2 \times H \times W$ (improving a prior 3D result from height $8$ to $2$);
    (4) with hexagonal prisms rather than cubes, each specified as going straight,
  turning $60^\circ$, or turning $120^\circ$; and
    (5) allowing the cubes to be encoded implicitly to compress exponentially large repetitions.
